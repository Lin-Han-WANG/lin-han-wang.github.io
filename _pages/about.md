Who I am
======
I successfully defended my Ph.D. in Neuroscience in November 2025 at the Institute of Neuroscience (ION), Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology (CEBSIT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), under the supervision of Dr. Yangang SUN. My doctoral research focused on how internal emotional states modulate sensory processing.

What I study
======
During my PhD, I combined single-cell calcium imaging (miniscope), circuit tracing, and opto-/chemogenetic manipulations to explore how stress modulates pain at the cellular and circuit level. I characterized how distinct neuronal subtypes in the central amygdala (CeA)—a hub for affective and nociceptive signals—represent nociceptive information. We revealed how stress reshapes these representations, identified the specific neuronal populations involved, and mapped key upstream brain regions and signaling pathways that convey stress-related signals. This work provides new insights into the cellular basis of stress-induced analgesia and illustrates how internal states dynamically shape sensory processing.

Skills & Approach
======
Through my PhD, I developed expertise in calcium imaging, behavioral paradigm design, circuit manipulation, and quantitative data analysis. I am trained to formulate scientific questions, design experiments, and carry projects from concept to publication.

Looking ahead
======
I am broadly interested in how the brain builds internal models of the world. My long-term goal is to combine experimental and computational approaches to understand how the brain encodes the external environment and how internal states dynamically modulate these representations.
