Who I am
======
I recently completed my Ph.D. in Neuroscience at the Institute of Neuroscience (ION), Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology (CEBSIT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). My doctoral research focused on how internal emotional states modulate sensory processing.

What I study
======
In my doctoral research, I employed single-cell calcium imaging (miniscope), circuit tracing, and opto-/chemo-genetic manipulations to dissect the cellular and circuit basis of stress induced analgesia. We provided the comprehensive characterization of how distinct neuronal subtypes in central amygdala (CeA, a hub that integrates affective and nociceptive signals) represent nociceptive information. Critically, we demonstrated how stress alters pain representation in the CeA and identified the specific neuronal populations involved in this modulation. Furthermore, we uncovered key upstream brain regions and signaling pathways that convey stress-related signals. This study not only fills a critical gap in our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying SIA but also broadens our perspective on how internal states dynamically interact with external stimuli. 

Skills & Approach
======
Through my PhD, I developed expertise in calcium imaging, behavioral paradigm design, circuit manipulation, and quantitative data analysis. I am trained to formulate scientific questions, design experiments, and carry projects from concept to publication.

Looking ahead
======
I am broadly interested in how the brain builds internal models of the world. My long-term goal is to combine experimental and computational approaches to understand how the brain encodes the external environment and how internal states dynamically modulate these representations.
